## BruteBot
- **BruteBot** is a Python tool that uses the [webbot](https://webbot.readthedocs.io/) library to automate brute-force attacks on login passwords, **especially for login pages protected by CSRF defenses or random tokens.**

- The choice of webbot, a library derived from Selenium, was intentional. The goal was to emulate a user navigating the target website’s login page and attempting to brute-force the password in the most unobtrusive manner.

- This approach ensures that any random tokens that are generated when the login page gets loaded are automatically included in the subsequent login `POST` requests, thereby making the automation of password brute-forcing possible.

- Furthermore, it gives you a chance to visualize the browser's operations in real time, which can be useful for troubleshooting.
<br><br>
## How BruteBot Operates?
- It retrieves the login page via a `GET` request.

- It utilizes the username / email address and the password list provided by you.

- It submits these credentials to the server via multiple `POST` requests (each containing a unique username-password combination), alongside any additional random tokens if present  (such as an anti-CSRF token, an arbitrary browser identifier, timestamp, etc.)

- It repeats this process until it successfully discovers the correct password.
<br><br>
## Requirements

1. Install `webbot` using the following command:

```bash
pip3 install webbot
```

2. Download or clone the repository.

3. Place your password list file in the same directory as `BruteBot.py`.
<br><br>
_That's it! You are good to go!_
<br><br>
## Usage

### Command
```
python3 BruteBot.py -t (LOGIN PAGE URL) -u USERNAME -p (PASSWORD LIST) --uid (USERNAME ELEMENT ID) --pid (PASSWORD ELEMENT ID) --bname (LOGIN BUTTON NAME) -m (visible / headless) -s (TIME IN SECONDS)
```

### Program Arguments
#### Required Arguments
- `-t` / `--target` : URL of the target website's login page

- `-u` / `--username` : A valid username / email address

- `-p` / `--plist` : Path of the password list file

- `--uid` : Username Element ID

- `--pid` : Password Element ID

- `--bname` : Name of the login button element

#### Optional Arguments
- `-m` / `--mode` : Sets the mode of operation

  - `headless` : To have all operations run in the background (Default mode: `headless`)

  - `visible` : To view the operations happening in your browser

- `-s` / `--time` : Duration, in seconds, for which the browser will wait before commencing the brute-forcing

- `-h` / `--help` : Shows the help message and exits
<br><br>
## Quickstart Guide

**Demo 1** - To run BruteBot with the default options:

```python
python3 BruteBot.py -t https://demo.testfire.net/login.jsp -u admin -p passwords.txt --uid uid --pid passw --bname Login
```

<br>

**Demo 2** - To see the browser tab(s) in action when BruteBot runs:

```python
python3 BruteBot.py -t https://demo.testfire.net/login.jsp -u admin -p passwords.txt --uid uid --pid passw --bname Login -m visible
```

<br>

**Demo 3** - To route the traffic through a network proxy while running BruteBot:

```python
python3 BruteBot.py -t https://demo.testfire.net/login.jsp -u admin -p passwords.txt --uid uid --pid passw --bname Login --proxy http://localhost:8080
```

## Planning a Graphical Interface

Are you exploring ways to layer a graphical user interface on top of the existing command-line workflow? Check out the new
[UI improvements guide](UI_IMPROVEMENTS.md) for suggestions on how to structure a lightweight controller panel, recommended
widgets, and ideas for keeping the automation features discoverable without overwhelming the operator.

## Graphical Interface

Prefer pointing and clicking over terminal commands? Launch the bundled Tkinter control panel to capture the same settings and
run BruteBot for you.

```bash
python3 brutebot_gui.py
```

The window prompts you for all required fields, lets you browse to a password list stored anywhere on disk, and streams the
script output into a scrollable log. Use the **Stop** button if you need to end the run early—the app will terminate the
underlying CLI process for you.
